# Digital Twin for Autonomous Mobile Robot using Unity

## Project Overview

This project implements a digital twin system for an autonomous mobile robot, leveraging Arduino-based hardware and Unity for visualization. The system provides real-time environment mapping and visualization, enhancing the robot's navigation capabilities.

## Duration

August 2022 - November 2022

## Key Features

1. **Sensor Integration**: Utilizes multiple sensors including IR, IMU, Gyroscope, and Ultrasound.
2. **Real-time Visualization**: Implements serial communication between Arduino and Unity for live environment mapping.
3. **Path Tracking**: Creates a virtual map of the robot's path and detected obstacles.
4. **Surface Texture Analysis**: Uses ground-facing IR sensor to determine and visualize surface textures in the virtual environment.

## Technical Details

- **Hardware**: Arduino-based robot with IR, IMU, Gyroscope, and Ultrasound sensors.
- **Software**: Unity for 3D visualization and mapping.
- **Communication**: Serial communication between Arduino and Unity.

## Implementation Highlights

1. **Sensor Fusion**: Combines data from multiple sensors for accurate environment mapping.
2. **Real-time Processing**: Achieves real-time visualization and mapping of the robot's environment.
3. **Dynamic Visualization**: Represents the robot's path, obstacles, and surface textures in the Unity-based virtual environment.

## Future Improvements

- Implement advanced path planning algorithms for more efficient navigation.
- Enhance obstacle avoidance capabilities.
- Improve the fidelity of the digital twin by adding more sensors or improving data processing algorithms.
